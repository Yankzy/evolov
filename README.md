1. Pull the DEV branch using `git pull git@github.com:Techtronixus/ProjectB.git DEV` 
2. Make a NEW BRANCH with your name and only commit to that branch using `git checkout -b <YOUR_NAME>`. 
3. Make a NEW BRANCH with your name and only commit to that branch using then `git checkout -b <YOUR_NAME>`. 
4. Open a pull request back to DEV branch when you complete a feature, I will review the code, if all is fine will merge it into dev
5. I will merge the code that we are completely done with into MASTER BRANCH and that will be the production branch
6. Open a pull request back to DEV branch when you complete a feature, I will review the code, if all is fine will merge it into dev
